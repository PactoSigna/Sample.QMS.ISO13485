        { "text": "Deploy directly to production for fastest delivery", "explanation": "Direct production deployment bypasses staging verification." },
        { "text": "Deploy to staging first and execute smoke tests", "correct": true, "explanation": "Per Section 5.4, software must be deployed to staging first with smoke tests before promotion to production." },
        { "text": "Get verbal approval from engineering", "explanation": "Quality must approve deployment via the deployment checklist." },

      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "Per Section 5.5, the first action is to assess severity and scope, then execute a rollback to the previous known-good version. A nonconformance report and CAPA come after containment."

        { "text": "The developer who wrote the code", "explanation": "The developer cannot self-approve a deployment." },
        { "text": "No approval required for automated deployments", "explanation": "All production deployments require Quality approval regardless of automation." }
